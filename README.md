# Freshbot - Discord Bot (Node.js Version)

## Setup Instructions

To set up the Freshbot Discord bot in a Node.js environment, follow these steps:

1. Ensure Node.js and npm (or yarn) are installed on your system.
2. Clone the repository to your local machine.
3. Navigate to the cloned repository's directory in your terminal.
4. Run `npm install` (or `yarn install`) to install the required dependencies.
5. Create a `config.json` file in the root directory with your Discord bot token and any other necessary configuration.
6. Start the bot by running `npm start` (or `yarn start`).

## Transition from Python to Node.js

This version of Freshbot has been rewritten in Node.js, replacing the previous Python version. The Python file `Freshbot(discordbot).py` has been removed, and new Node.js specific files such as `package.json` and `bot.js` have been added to the repository.
